# Graphou is a software framework to work on graphs and social networks. It helps you to:

    draw a graph
    get reports about it
    run algorithms on it
    visualize it
    save it (xml format using *.kmk extension)
    restore it

DOWNLOAD Graphou

it runs under window/linux/mac osx (based on java).

#RUN execute dist/Graphe_kibongue.jar

#DEVELOP for working on the source,

#What can you do with Graphou ?

    Drawing your graph with mouse or restore existing graphs.

    Getting information about your graphs, like num of connected components, chromatic number, and etc.

    Run algorithms step by step on your graph and see how they work. This is very usefull for teaching graph algorithms.

    Visualizing your graphs. You made a social network from your database and want to represent it in a meaningfull way? Use the visualizations.

    Presenting your graphs in your papers, websites or reports. When you finish drawing your graph, you can save to a xml file using *.kmk format even to a text document to put in your report.
